- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tedlozzo, Engineering Leader â€¢ Hands-On Architect â€¢ Data Enthusiast â€¢ Delivery Manager :rocket:
- :eyes: I dabble in everything from BigQuery to Terraform, all while trying not to break production (too often).
- :heavy_check_mark: I focus on solutions you can try today, minus the fluff or overpromises.

  - *Solving the Unsolvable.* Because you only know if itâ€™s unsolvable after youâ€™ve tried, right?
  - *Data Wrangling.* Crafting data pipelines, hacking on LookerStudio, and generally showing data whoâ€™s boss.

```python
def silver_bullet(problems):
    try:
        # Sorry, there's no one-size-fits-all solution
        raise NotImplementedError("No silver bullets here.")
    except NotImplementedError as e:
        return str(e)

print(silver_bullet("Tech Trouble"))
# Output: "No silver bullets here."
